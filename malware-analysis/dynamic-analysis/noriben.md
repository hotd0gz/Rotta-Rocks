# Noriben

## Introduction

[Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) is a powerfull tool that acts as a python wrapper for [Sysinternals ProcMon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon). It adds an additional layer of malware-specific intelligence to the process.

Noriben's integration with YARA rules is another notable feature. We can leverage YARA rules to enhance our data filtering capabilities, allowing us to identify patterns of interest more efficiently.
