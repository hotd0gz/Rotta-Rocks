# Dynamic Analysis

## Introduction

Dynamic analysis, also known as behavioral analysis, is the act of interpreting the behavior of the malware while it's running. The primary goal is to disect the real-world impact of the malware on it's host environment.

Here is what we need to be succesful:

**1.) Environment setup**: This VM should mimic a real-world system, it should include applications, office tools, communication platforms(teams, cisco jabber, discord), web browsers, documents, and more.

**2.)** **Baseline Capture**: After the VM is setup, we capture a snippet of of the systems clean state. Before the malware is executed.

**3.) Tool Deployment (Pre-execution)**: We deploy tools to monitor the system before executing the malware.

**4.) Malware Execution**: With the tools runnning to observe the malware, we run execute the malware.

**5.) Observation & Logging**: During this time we are monitoring the changes, and behavior of the malware.

**6.) Analysis & Data Collection**: We stop the malware, run further analysis and create an image of the host post-execution.
