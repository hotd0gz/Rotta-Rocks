# Network Traffic Analysis

## Introduction

It's crucial that we understand the networking behind a binary. What connections it's making, what protocol it utilizes and the host it's attempting to communicate with.



## Wireshark

We will run the following binary on our kali machine using mono. Wine will also work.

```bash
└─$ mono ./UserInfo.exe -v find -first testr
[*] LDAP query to use: (givenName=testr)
[-] Exception: No Such Object
                              
```

We notice that the binary is making a connection using the ldap protocol, which is unencryted. The username and password is in plaintext.
