# Reverse Engineering / Code Analysis

## Introduction

The best possible understanding we can achieve from Malware is having access to it's source code. With the absence of source code, we can use analysis tools to extract code instructions via reverse engineering.

* **Dissassembler**: Useful for static analysis:  `IDA`, `Cutter`, and `Ghidra`.
* **Debugger**: Useful for dynamic analysis:  `x32dbg`, `x64dbg`, `IDA`, and `OllyDbg`.
