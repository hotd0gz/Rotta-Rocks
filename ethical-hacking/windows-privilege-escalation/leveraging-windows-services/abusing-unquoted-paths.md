  Each Windows Service maps to an executable file that is run when the service
  is started. If the path to this file contains one or more spaces, we may be
  able to take advantage and escalate privileges.

# Abusing Unquoted Paths

***



## Background

When a Windows service is started, Win32 API [CreateProcess](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa) is called. `lpApplicationName` is the name of the executable and optionally the full path. If the provided string contains spaces and is not inclosed in quotation marks, it can be interpreted in various ways.

```c
BOOL CreateProcessA(
  [in, optional]      LPCSTR                lpApplicationName,
  [in, out, optional] LPSTR                 lpCommandLine,
  [in, optional]      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes,
  [in, optional]      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,
  [in]                BOOL                  bInheritHandles,
  [in]                DWORD                 dwCreationFlags,
  [in, optional]      LPVOID                lpEnvironment,
  [in, optional]      LPCSTR                lpCurrentDirectory,
  [in]                LPSTARTUPINFOA        lpStartupInfo,
  [out]               LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation
);
```

Let's say we have the lpApplicationName of `C:\Program Files\My Program\My service\service.exe`

We can try to abuse this by adding .`exe` to the end of each space.

```
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files\My.exe
C:\Program Files\My Program\My.exe
C:\Program Files\My Program\My service\service.exe
```

We create a malicious binary and place it in each directory shown above.

## Example

### Enumerating Services



```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName 
```

```
wmic service get name,pathname | findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\" | findstr /i /v """
```



We start by enumerating services and find the ones that have spaces in their filepaths.

## Enumerating Permissions

Once we've enumerated the installed service and found one of interest, we can view the permissions.  We can use tools like: _**icacls**_ Windows utility or the PowerShell Cmdlet _**Get-ACL**_

| MASK | PERMISSIONS             |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| F    | Full access             |
| M    | Modify access           |
| RX   | Read and execute access |
| R    | Read-only access        |
| W    | Write-only access       |

###

### Checking Permissions

We need to make sure we have permissions in each path that we want to add our malicios binary:

```
PS C:\Users\steve> icacls "C:\"
C:\ BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
    NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
    BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(RX)
    NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(M)
    NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(AD)
    Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level:(OI)(NP)(IO)(NW)
    
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
    
PS C:\Users\steve>icacls "C:\Program Files"
C:\Program Files NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
                 NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(F)
                 NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(M)
                 NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                 BUILTIN\Administrators:(M)
                 BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                 BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
                 BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
                 CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
...

```



### We then copy out executable to these file paths and rename them accordingly. Don't forget to delete them after your finished & restore the original binary!
