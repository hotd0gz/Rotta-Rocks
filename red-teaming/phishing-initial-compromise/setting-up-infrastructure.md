# Setting up Infrastructure



## Introduction



### Domain Names

When picking a domain for our infrastructure, there are some things we need to keep in mind.

#### Web Categorization

Domain names are categorized by vendors for filtering processes. Domains that are related to gambling, social media, or drugs can be blocked. Domain names like "Health Services" or "Finance" are good choices as some organizations utilize HTTPS decryption and will be less likely to decrypt potentially sensitive traffic.

We can use [expireddomains.net](https://www.expireddomains.net/) & Palo Altos "[Test A Site](https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/query/)" to find the right domain for our infrastructure.



### Email Filtering





### Content Filtering

Web proxies have the ability to read and inspect HTTPS traffic for malicious content. One common tactic organizations utilze is to block file extensions such as .exe, .ps1, .dll, etc.
