# External Recon

## Introduction

The topic of external enumeration is vast and largely depends on the level of engagement. Here are some good things to check for when getting started.

I like to generally create a mind map that includes the below two:

## Organizational Reconnaisance

* People
* Jobs
* Skills
* Office / Job site locations
* Business Relationships
* Organizational Structure

## Technical Reconnaisance

* Public-Facing Websites
* Mail servers
* Remote access solutions
* Any vendors or products in use
* Web proxies
* Email gateways
* Firewalls
* Anti-virus and other defenses



## Passive Collection

We **are not** actively touching the components of the organization.

* Linkedin
* Shodan
* Other social media
* Google Dorks
* DNS Records & Email Security
* Hunter.io

## Active Collection

We **are** actively touching components of the organization. We should be doing active recon with a Proxy & VPN.

* Acunetix, Burp, etc.
