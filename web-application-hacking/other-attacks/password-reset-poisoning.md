  Password Reset Poisoning is a technique where an attacker manipulates a
  vulnerable website into generating a reset link pointing to a domain they
  control.

# Password Reset Poisoning

One of the most common approaches goes something like this:

1. The user enters their username or email address and submits a password reset request.
2. The website checks that this user exists and then generates a temporary, unique, high-entropy token, which it associates with the user's account on the back-end.
3.  The website sends an email to the user that contains a link for resetting their password. The user's unique reset token is included as a query parameter in the corresponding URL:

    `https://normal-website.com/reset?token=0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j`
4. When the user visits this URL, the website checks whether the provided token is valid and uses it to determine which account is being reset. If everything is as expected, the user is given the option to enter a new password. Finally, the token is destroyed.





### Constructing Password Reset Poisoning Attack

1. The attacker obtains the victim's email address or username, as required, and submits a password reset request on their behalf. When submitting the form, they intercept the resulting HTTP request and modify the Host header so that it points to a domain that they control. For this example, we'll use `evil-user.net`.
2.  The victim receives a genuine password reset email directly from the website. This seems to contain an ordinary link to reset their password and, crucially, contains a valid password reset token that is associated with their account. However, the domain name in the URL points to the attacker's server:

    `https://evil-user.net/reset?token=0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j`
3. If the victim clicks this link (or it is fetched in some other way, for example, by an antivirus scanner) the password reset token will be delivered to the attacker's server.
4. The attacker can now visit the real URL for the vulnerable website and supply the victim's stolen token via the corresponding parameter. They will then be able to reset the user's password to whatever they like and subsequently log in to their account.
