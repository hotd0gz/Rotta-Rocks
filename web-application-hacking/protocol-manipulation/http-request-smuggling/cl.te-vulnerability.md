# CL.TE Vulnerability

_<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT:**</mark>_

These techniques are only possible using HTTP/1 requests. Browsers and other clients, including Burp, use HTTP/2 by default to communicate with servers that explicitly advertise support for it via ALPN as part of the TLS handshake. As a result, when testing sites with HTTP/2 support, you need to manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater. You can do this from the **Request attributes** section of the **Inspector** panel.



Here, the front-end server uses the Content-Length header and the back-end server uses Transfer-Encoding. We can perform a simple HTTP request smuggling attack as follows:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

The front-end server processes the Content-Length header and determines the request body is 13 bytes long and forwards it to the back-end server.



The back-end server processes the Transfer-Encoding header, it processes the first chunk which is zero, so is treated as the terminating request. The "_**SMUGGLED**_" is left unprocessed and the back-end server treats these as the start of the next request.
