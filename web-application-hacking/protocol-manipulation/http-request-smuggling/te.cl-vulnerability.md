These techniques are only possible using HTTP/1 requests. Browsers and other clients, including Burp, use HTTP/2 by default to communicate with servers that explicitly advertise support for it via ALPN as part of the TLS handshake. As a result, when testing sites with HTTP/2 support, you need to manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater. You can do this from the **Request attributes** section of the **Inspector** panel.
