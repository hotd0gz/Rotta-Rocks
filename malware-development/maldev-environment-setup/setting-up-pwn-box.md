# Setting up Pwn Box



## Installing Windows 11 Evaluation Image

The first step is to install Windows 11. Like most people, I like to get things for free. We can get a free Windows 11 ISO from the Windows evaluation center. You will need a domain joined email account.

I won't go into detail on setting up the virtual machine. Any vm provider will do. I like VMware Workstation.





## Installing Microsoft Application

We wan't to set up the machine to resemble an actual victims host environment. We will install the common enterprise Microsoft applications. Teams, Microsoft Office, Skype, Google Chrome, and others.

## Create Tools Folder

We will create a Tools folder at C:\Tools\\. When developing our programs, we'll need to omit this folder path.
