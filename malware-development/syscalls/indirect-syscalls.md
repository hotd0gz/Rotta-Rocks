# Indirect Syscalls

_<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT:**</mark>_

As EDR vendors improve, it's becoming harder and harder to use direct syscalls for Initial access, credential dumping, lateral movement etc. The reason is EDR vendors are implementing better mechanisms to detect common techniques that utilize direct syscalls.&#x20;



To avoid detection and eliminate the possibility of IOC we can replace direct syscalls with indirect syscalls.
