  "Stomping" is when we overwrite or replace the memory of a data structure in a
  program with different data. Function stomping is a technique where we replace
  a functions logic with our own.

# Function Stomping



***

## Choosing a Target Function

When choosing a target function & module it's best to avoid modules / functions that can be risky. For example: `ntdll.dll`, `kernel32.dll`, and `kernelbase32.dll`are generally best to avoid, and should be used with caution.

_<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT:**</mark>_ In order for function stomping to be performed on remote processes, the DLL that exports the targeted function must be already loaded into the target process.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:red;">**Note:**</mark>_ For shared DLL's between processes, the _**functions**_ within the DLL have the same address in each process. However, the address of the _**DLL**_ itself will differ between processes due to the different virtual address spaces.
