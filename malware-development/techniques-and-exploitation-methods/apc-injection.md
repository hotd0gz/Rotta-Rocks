# APC Injection

## Introduction

APCs are implemented as kernel-mode routines that are executed in the context of a specific thread. We can leverage APCs to queue a payload and then have it execute when scheduled.

### Alertable State

Not all threads can run a queued APC function, only threads in an _**alterable state**_ can do so.
