  * **Universal Forwarder (UF)**: Individual, lightweight, software packages that collect data and forwards it to Splunks indexers.
  * **Heavy Forwarders (HF)**: Uses for intensive data aggreagation. Typically depoyed as dedicated nodes. They exclusively support Splunk enterprise.
* **Indexers**: Receives data from forwarders, organizes it, and stores it in indexes. Creates directories categorizes by age.
* **Search Head**s: Coordinates search jobs, dispatching them to indexers and merging results.
* **Deployment Server**: Manages configuration for forwarders, distributing apps and updates.
