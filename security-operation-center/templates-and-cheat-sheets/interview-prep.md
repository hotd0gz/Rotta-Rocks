### Scheduled Task Protection & Mitigation

* Configure OS to force scheduled tasks to only run under the authenticated users instead of system accounts. This is done by editing the HKLM/SYSTEM registry key. For orgs, this can be configured globally through the GPO for all workstations.
* Set the GPO to only allow admins to schedule tasks.



### Registry Run Keys Protection & Mitigation

**Note:** There are startup folders for both local and system-level accounts.
