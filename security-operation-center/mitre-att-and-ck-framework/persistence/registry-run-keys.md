# Registry Run Keys



## Introduction&#x20;

The goal with registry run keys is to quickly establish permissions and persistence on a system. By adding a run key to the start up folder, that process will run everytime an authenticated user logs in.

Note: Startup folders are different for both local-user and system-level accounts.

## What is the Windows Registry?

The registry is a file system that stores application settings, low-level system settings, and user preferences.&#x20;



## Registry Structure

* Hives: Contain keys (directories) and values.
* Keys: May contain subkeys and/or values.
* Subkeys: no difference between keys. Just a sub structure of a key.
* Values: Stores the data associated with it's key.

## Registry Root Keys:

| Root Key                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| <p>HKU<br>(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)</p> | Contains computer-specific information about the hardware installed, software settings, and other information.

| <p>HKU<br>(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)</p> | Contains infomration about all the users who log on to the computer. Both generic and user-specific information.                                                                                                                                                                  |

## What is a Registry Run Key?

Registry Run Keys cause programs to run each time a user logs on. Threat actors often create a Run key so that their code will persist once a user logs in again.

The simpler two tactics is using the Windows startup folder located at:

### **C:\Users\\\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.**

* Shortcut links (.link extension) placed in this folder will cause Windows to launch the application each time \<username> logs in. This is used by various forms of malware.



### The registry run keys perform the same action, but can be located in the four different locations:

* HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

The difference between HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER & HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE is whether the executable launches for EVERY user that logs in or just a specific user.

Run and RunOnce; the only difference is that RunOnce will automatically delete the entry upon successful execution.



### The following registry run keys can be used to set startup folders items for persistence:

Placing a malicious file under the startup directories is often used by malware authors.

* HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
* HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders



### The following registry keys can control automatic startup of services on boot:

* HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

## Detection and Mitigation

In order to have proper visibilty and effective detections the following must be in place:

* Command-line logging.
* FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) or a tool like SysInterals to detect file-level changes.
* Windows Security Events (ETW).
* Network Logging
