# Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)



### SSTI Identification:

The diagram below can help us identify if we are dealing with an SSTI vulnerability and also identify the underlying template engine.

In addition to the above diagram, we can try the following approaches to recognize the technology we are dealing with:

* Check verbose errors for technology names. Sometimes just copying the error in Google search can provide us with a straight answer regarding the underlying technology used
* Check for extensions. For example, .jsp extensions are associated with Java. When dealing with Java, we may be facing an expression language/OGNL injection vulnerability instead of traditional SSTI
* Send expressions with unclosed curly brackets to see if verbose errors are generated. Do not try this approach on production systems, as you may crash the webserver.



_**The following payload from CobaltStrike is a popular identifier of SSTI:**_

```
${{<%[%'"}}%\.
```

_**More payloads:**_

```
 *{7*7}
 ${7*7}
 ${{7*7}}
 #{7*7}
 <%= 7*7 %>
```

<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark> When searching for SSTI don't forget to include URLS.

```
curl -gs "http://<TARGET IP>:<PORT>/execute?cmd={{7*'7'}}"
```
