# Commando VM



## Introduction

Alternatively, we if we don't want to install our own fresh Windows environment we can just use Mandiant's "Command VM".  This can be very useful and easy when we just want to test, or compile windows exploits on a seperate virtual machine.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">NOTE:</mark> When testing "production" malware, we should follow the directions in Setting up Pwn Box as the point is to replicate a real life Windows environment and not one jam packed with malicious tools.
