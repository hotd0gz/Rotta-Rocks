# Local PE Injection

## Introduction

Local PE Injection is a way to utilize Position Indepened Code (PIC) to execute a PE entirely in memory of the host process. We can build a PE loader to run malicious binaries entirely in memory to avoid detection. An example would be to run **mimikatz.exe** or **Sharphound.exe** in memory.

## Local PE Injection Steps

Like Reflective DLL injection there are requirements to locally injection a PE in memory.

&#x20;  1.) Allocate enough memory for the PE file buffer.

&#x20;  2.) Copy the PE sections to the allocated buffer.

&#x20;  3.) Patch the PE's relocations.

&#x20;  4.) Path the PE's Import Address Table (IAT)

&#x20;  5.) Set memory permissions for each of the PE's sections.

&#x20;  6.) Execute the PE's entry point.
